== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I create a survey? =

After installing the Plugin, you can see a "WPDudes Survey" in your WordPress Admin panel on the left sidebar menu. Click that, and click the "Create Survey Link". Enter the details of the Survey and you're done!

= How can I check results of the survey? =

To view the results, you have to wait until the appropriated amount of users have submitted their feedback. Since this is a completely anonymous survey, even the admin cannot view the results before the appropriated percentage of submissions is complete.

= How can I delete a survey? =

In order to delete a survey, just click the big red button called DELETE on the listing of the surveys.

= I don't have WordPress installed, what should I do? =

If you don't have WordPress and have a custom script or other CMS installed, you can either install WP and move to WP, or you can contact us on support@wpdudes.com and ask for a custom version of this plugin to work on your script.
